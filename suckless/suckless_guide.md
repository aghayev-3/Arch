# Suckless - Software That Sucks Less

## What is DWM and who uses it?
* dwm is a lightweight window manager for Linux that helps you manage open windows on your screen.
* Why use dwm?
    * Fast and Lightweight: Uses minimal system resources.
    * Customizable: You can easily change it to fit your needs.
    * Keyboard Navigation: Allows quick control using the keyboard, which can speed up your workflow.
    * Simple Design: Offers a clean and distraction-free workspace.
* A window manager is software that controls the placement and appearance of windows on a computer screen. It manages how windows are opened, closed, resized, and moved around.

## Installation
* `git clone https://git.suckless.org/dwm` to obtain the dwm code from their website
* `git clone https://git.suckless.org/dmenu` to obtain the dmenu code
* You should have two directories (folders) called `dwm` and `dmenu` respectively :)
* Go into each one of them and run `sudo make clean install` to compile the code
* This basically builds the software from the components that we downloaded from the website

### Notes:
* DWM is the window manager itself, and Dmenu is a lightweight menu that helps you run things seamlessly :)
