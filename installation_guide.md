# Arch Installation Guide
Many thanks to Learn Linux TV

## Downloading the ISO image
* Go to the [download page](https://archlinux.org/download/) and proceed to one of the HTTP/HTTPS mirrors. 
* Download the file that ends with `.iso` (it should be the first file on the list)

## Create bootable installation media
* Here is a [detailed guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xuP1GQLPpI) on how to accomplish that :)
* You can also create a [Ventoy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10L8aCY3VBs) bootable flash drive, which allows you to have multiple `ISO` files in a single drive :)

## Boot into the Installation media
* This is different on every computer, you need to go to the [UEFI settings](https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/windows-11/how-to-enter-uefi-on-devices-running-windows-11) and make sure that you boot into the flash drive on which you installed the `ISO` file
* If [Secure Boot](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-11-and-secure-boot-a8ff1202-c0d9-42f5-940f-843abef64fad) is enabled you have to disable it for the duration of the installation, but you can enable it after the system is up and running :)

## General Notes
* Make sure to check out the [Arch Linux Wiki page](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Main_page)
